This is a recreation of classic snake. Made to be run in the browser, this game has all the basic functionality of snake including points. It also features a difficulty setting which changes how quickly the snake speeds up.

The basic set up of the game was written in plain JavaScript with the actual game display created using purely CSS selectors and JQuery.
